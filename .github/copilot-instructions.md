- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created — file added for workspace bootstrap.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements — target: technical docs, LangChain, Neo4j, minimal prototype.

- [x] Scaffold the Project — created Python package skeleton, CLI stubs, sample docs, and dependency manifest.

- [x] Customize the Project — implemented ingestion, vector, graph, and chat pipeline modules with Typer CLI.

- [x] Install Required Extensions — no additional extensions requested.

- [x] Compile the Project — `/Users/macairm1teddy/miniconda3/bin/python -m pip install -e .` failed (proxy blocked setuptools download).

- [x] Create and Run Task — added "Hybrid RAG CLI Help" task (fails until dependencies are installed locally).

- [ ] Launch the Project — awaiting user confirmation for preferred launch/debug mode.

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete — README updated with setup/usage guidance and this file cleaned of HTML comments.

- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
